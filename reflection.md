1. My code functions so that it creates a resume on a webpage. Main key points are its uses of lists for arrangements, h1 and up for cleaning up appropriate text. The <sections> divide the main points of the resume (About Me, Skills, Experience, and Education).

2. My coding process was mainly referencing my lab and the demonstration given. Since it was a resume, I thought it would share similarities such as formatting and arrangement in general. All what changed was the context.

3. I had challenges incorporating an SVG. I still am confused about how to code proper SVGs and how to properly implement it on a website. I also had struggles with the website checker which outlined several errors.

4. I would arrange my code at the start more efficiently. I think with this I would not struggle so much on editing my code whether for errors on the website or the code itself.
